# Movie Showings

The app uses Bootstrap to style cards that contain information about movies that can be loaded from JSON or other sources.

## Installation

1. Simply clone the repository
2. Go to `https://www.omdbapi.com/` and register for an API key.
3. Place your key in a file called `omdb-api-key.js` and set the variable `apiKey` equal to the key.
4. With npm installed and the http-server package added, run "http-server -c-1"
5. Open your web browser to `http://localhost:8080/`

## Usage

Once the webapge is loaded you should see the list of movies.

## Support

Use this program at your own risk. If it does not behave correctly, challenge yourself to find the issues and share your fixes with the rest of the community!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future I would like to tie this to other movies sources.
